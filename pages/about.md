Hi! This microsite is my (Brian Koser) favorite opening lines from books. Note that it's my favorite opening lines from books, not the opening lines of my favorite books (although there is overlap).

## Contact
If you have an opening line you think I should add, or have any other questions or comments, email <a href="mailto:contact@koser.us">contact@koser.us</a>.

## Trivia
- Many ancient cultures named works by their incipits: the first few words of the text. For example, *Genesis* is Greek for "beginning"â€”"In the beginning".
