Hi! This microsite is my (Brian Koser) favorite first lines from books. Note that it's my favorite first lines from books, not the first lines of my favorite books (although there is overlap).

## Contact
If you know a first line that I should add, or have any other questions or comments, email <a href="mailto:contact@koser.us">contact@koser.us</a>.

## Trivia
- Many ancient cultures named works by their incipits: the first few words of the text. For example, *Genesis* is Greek for "beginning"â€”"In the beginning".
