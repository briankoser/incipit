Hi! This microsite is my (Brian Koser) favorite incipits: first lines from a book. Note that it's my favorite first lines from books, not the first lines of my favorite books (although there is overlap).

## Contact
If you know an incipit that I should add, or have any other questions or comments, email me at <a href="mailto:contact@koser.us">contact@koser.us</a>.

## Trivia
- Until modern times, books were often named by their first lines.
